“You walk up to the desk to get your MTU ID.”
“What’s your name?”
“Gender?”
“Alright, stand over in front of the camera, this’ll just take a second.”
“Although your past is a bit hazy, you find yourself sitting in the middle of the crowd at an introductory presentation.”
“Which major did you choose when you came to college?”
“Ah, yes, you remember choosing Engineering as your major.” 
“Ah, yes, you remember choosing Computer Science as your major.” 
“Ah, yes, you remember choosing Mathematics as your major.” 
“Ah, yes, you remember choosing Acccounting as your major.” 
“As you listen along, you realize thinking in the second person about yourself is weird, and suddenly, the text changes”
“Although your choice to go to this college split you from your best friend, you still resolved to communicate with each other on a regular basis.”
“You realize, to your surprise, that you forgot to put your friend’s name as a contact.”
“Gender?”
“As the overly enthusiastic presenters are met with nearly as enthusiastic responses, you wonder how your first year here will go.”
“A few months go by…”
“You wake up to the blaring of your roommate’s alarm at 7:30.” (insert alarm sound)
“You groan and roll over, covering your ears with your pillow in a vain attempt to get rid of the noise.” (muffled alarm sound)
“After what feels like hours, your roommate finally shuts off (his/her) alarm, gets up, and leaves.” (footsteps)
“Muttering to yourself how your roommate should really pay more attention, you lazily grab your phone to check the time.”
“8:45! Your first class is at 9:00!”
“With a rush of nervous adrenaline, you climb off your bed, pull some clothes on, quickly check your backpack, and run out the door.”
“Don’t forget to shut the door!”
“Hearing your other roommate yell as you nearly make it away, you quickly shut the door and continue on your way.”

“”What month is it again?” 
“Looking to the calendar, you realize that it’s already February.”
